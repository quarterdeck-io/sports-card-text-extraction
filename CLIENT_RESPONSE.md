# Client Response - Export Settings & Multiple Card Lots

---

## Response to Client Feedback

Hi [Client Name],

Thanks for the feedback! Here's the status on both items:

### 1. Export Settings Per Session ✅
**Status:** Ready to implement

I'll add session-based export preferences so users set their export destination (CSV or Google Sheets) once per session. All subsequent cards will automatically export to that destination, eliminating repetitive clicks during bulk processing.

**Timeline:** Can implement this week (2-3 hours)

### 2. Multiple Card Lots - Need Clarification
**Status:** Need details before estimating

To provide an accurate timeline and complexity assessment, could you clarify:

1. **What are the "two types" of card lots?** (e.g., single image with multiple cards, batch upload, different card categories, etc.)
2. **How should each type be processed differently?**
3. **What's the priority/urgency?** (Can we implement after export settings, or is this urgent?)

Once I understand the requirements, I can give you a timeline and complexity estimate.

**Next Steps:**
- I'll proceed with export settings implementation
- Please provide details on the multiple card lots feature when convenient

Thanks!

[Your Name]
